Hi there. Not much explanantion needed here. Simply run the program 
and see that A* pathfinding was used to make an enemy chase the player.
As requested, a Line is drawn to show the path the enemy will take. I 
purposfully made the enemy quite slow so that you can see that it is following
the path correctly and that you can manouvre around pretty easily to see how
the path corrects itself. No improved A.I mechanics included here so, you
don't have to look out for those. Lastly, I spoke to Timothy Gwynn and he told 
me it was ok for me to use a pretty basic environment to display the pathfinding
(I used the collision detection environment). I'm sure if he told me this then 
you as a tutor would already know but just in case i thought I'd mention it. 

Thats it from me, Enjoy your day/evening :)
